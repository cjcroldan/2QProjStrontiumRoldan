                <h2 id="subHeader7"> More Inclusive Spaces for LGBTQ+ Discourse</h2>
                <p>
                    The LGBTQ+ terms and social discourse are often discussed among those within the LGBTQ+ community. They use these terminologies and go through experiences that come with being part of the community. If it would be passed, it would give a wider and more inclusive space to share this information and experiences with those that aren’t part of the community. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Those outside the community would also have a familiar grasp of some misconceptions about the community and of actions that may harm them. LGBTQ+ terminologies of different sexualities, gender expression, and gender identity. It would clear the air of the ignorance of some people and raise their awareness of how some stereotypes harm the community. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People would identify misconceptions, such as associating someone's sexuality with their gender expression. An example would be assuming that a woman acting masculine is a lesbian or a man acting feminine is gay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It includes knowing how to treat those in the community with respect and dignity. Examples of these are using people's preferred pronouns and names and not mocking someone for the way they express their gender, such as the way they dress or speak. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Raised with different beliefs, some people would still be stubborn and hold on to their preconceived notions about the community. They wouldn’t change their outlook unless it is held against their will that it would be against the law if they would act upon their prejudice. Spreading information to these people for a more inclusive LGBTQ+ outlook may not be very fruitful. At least LGBTQ+ members wouldn’t worry much about discrimination in sharing these experiences with those that wish to learn or express themselves since there is a law that helps them against those.

                <p>
                    Other than the technical terms talked about in the community, the discrimination that they face because of their SOGIE is something we shouldn’t avoid talking about.
                    <br><br>A well-known case was the homicide case of Jennifer Laude. Jennifer Laude, who was a transgender woman, was killed because of their SOGIE, and this case was dismissed by the president years from when it happened. Its dismissal caused a major uproar in the LGBTQ+ community. They believed that it was unrighteous to pardon the killer simply because he were part of the US marine.
                    <br><br>A news report made below summarizes the case.

                    We may be a country filled with those in the LGBT community, but our recognition for the community wouldn't stop the discrimination they face. Our acceptance or tolerance doesn’t free them from discrimination, and we are not seeing the bigger picture of what they’re going through. Being ignorant of their existence may even harm them and feed into stereotypes or microaggressions. While there are anti-discriminatory laws, they aren’t specified for those crimes for SOGIE and most commonly these crimes are often left unjustified.

                <h2 id="subHeader9"> Benefits Even Those Outside the LGBTQ+ Community</h2>
                <p>
                    Some might believe that these rights elevate the status of those in the LGBTQ+ community, but this isn’t the case. These rights only protect them from discrimination and elevate them to those outside the community. They are considered special rights, but they aren’t unfair. Those outside the community simply don’t face the same discrimination and harassment as those in the LGBTQ+ community for their identities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although not part of the LGBTQ community, Heterosexual men and women would get to freely express themselves without getting harassed for being insinuated as gay by just having a different gender expression. SOGIE won’t only protect those in the LGBT community but those with SOGIE, which is everyone. We all get to benefit from it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People might think this may affect their right to exercise their religion, but it doesn't since the SOGIE bill doesn't specify anything about religion being involved. Those in religious communities can still exercise their faith freely as long as it doesn’t infringe anyone’s rights. Discriminating someone’s SOGIE is not intrinsic to any religion, so there isn’t any reason for it to be justified.
