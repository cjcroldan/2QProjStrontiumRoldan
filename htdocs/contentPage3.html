                    <h3>2000</h3>
                    In the year 2000, he SOGIE Bill or also known as the “Anti-Discriminatory Bill” was first filed in congress by former Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago and Etta Rosales, who is a former Akbayan party-list Representative. It was approved by the House of Representatives on the third reading but wasn’t fruitful in passing it through the Senate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was filed during the 15 and 16th Congress but it wasn’t successful in passing it again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>2016</h3>
                    Around June to November of 2016, eleven measures that were similar to the SOGIE Equality bill were filed at the House of Representatives in the 17th Congress. 
                    On August 11, 2016, Senator Risa Hontiveros filed the Senate version of the bill, and she sponsored on December 14 of the same year, while its House counterpart remains pending.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>2017</h3>
                    On February 7, 2017, the House Bill 4982 substituted the 11 measures filed and was approved by the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality.
                    On February 15, 2017 it was then it was set for plenart deliberations after it was referred to the Committee on Rules. 
                    After it had gone through its period of sponsorship and interpellations, the individual amendments on August 22, 2017 began, and the bill was approved in its 2nd hearing on September 13, 2017.
                    On September 20, 2017 (17 years of its first filing), it was approved by the House of Representatives with a proclamation vote of 197 to 0 negative and abstain votes, which passes its first hearing and was a big milestone for the bill.
                    After its approval in the House of Representatives, it was transmitted to the Senate on October 3, 2017 for their decision on the bill.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>2018</h3>
                    In May 2018, one of the government officials who opposes the bill, which is senator Tito Sotto, became the new Senate President, and heavily disproved the passage of the bill in an interview he had.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>2019</h3>
                    Before the SOGIE bill is due for its second reading by June 2019, it was languished after suffering 3 years of interpellations. This was before the 17th Congress ended. In summary, the Senate version of the bill reached 902 calendar days, and six interpellations and five inquiries. It was one of the slowest-moving bills in Philippine history since it took 17 years after its first filing for its approval in the House of Representatives.
                    After its languished state in the Senate, Senator Risa Hontiveros still perseveres in passing the bill. She delivers a speech on August 14, 2019 renevwing her call for the new 18th Congress to pass the SOGIE bill. 
                    Several senators were against the bill, including Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, Senator Panfilo Lacson, and the Senate President Tito Sotto. They expressed the preconceived harm that the bill might bring to those outside the LGBTQ+ community. Senator Tito Sotto even added that the bill had no chance passing the upper chamber, which was the Senate.
                    <br>

                    In 2020, Senator Risa Hontiveros once again pushed for its passage by updating a newer version of the bill taht includes prohibiting violence against sex characteristics after a transgender woman was denied access to using a female public restroom. 
                    On November 27 of the same year, Senator Risa Hontiveros, who chaired the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality, passed the SOGIE Equality Bill. 
                    The Committe report was signed by eight senators, which makes it win Senate Committee approval. It moves to the senate plenary as next step into becoming law.
                    Unfortunately, it was removed from the daily agenda of the Senate in the last minute, an action that was approved by the Senate President, Tito Sotto.
